# Lab 3: Mobile System Evaluation

**Course:** CSCI 4771 / 5771 – Introduction to Mobile Computing
**Instructor:** Dr. Zhengxiong Li
**Author:** Shivam Pathak 
**Due Date:** September 24, 2025 @ 11:59 PM

## 📌 Overview

In this lab, we design and implement a **Mobile System Evaluation Framework** that simulates and evaluates a **screen attack detection system** using **mmWave sensing**.
The framework follows the **WaveSpy evaluation methodology** from lecture and emphasizes metrics, robustness testing, and real-world performance analysis.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a **Python-based evaluation suite**.
* Define **evaluation metrics** for system performance.
* Test system robustness against multiple attack scenarios.
* Generate **comprehensive evaluation reports** for analysis.

## ⚙️ Setup & Requirements

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd lab3
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Recommended libraries:

   * `numpy`
   * `matplotlib`
   * `scipy`
   * `pandas`
   * `scikit-learn`

---

## 🚀 Usage

Run the evaluation framework:

```bash
python evaluation.py --scenario scenarios/attack1.json
```

Generate a performance report:

```bash
python report_generator.py --output results/report.pdf
```

---

## 📊 Deliverables

* **Code**: Python-based evaluation suite.
* **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, robustness.
* **Reports**: Summarizing system performance under various scenarios.

---

## 📝 Notes

* Follow the **WaveSpy methodology** discussed in lecture.
* Robustness testing should include multiple attack vectors.
* Reports must be clear, reproducible, and include visualizations.
